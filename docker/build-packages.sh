# `pacman -Syu` runs in the Dockerfile, but that is a LAYER, and the layer is
# cached: nothing in the Dockerfile changes between releases, so the database
# baked into it is as old as the last time the image was rebuilt from scratch.
# Arch mirrors carry one version of a package and delete the rest, so a
# fortnight-old database names files that are no longer there.
#
# That is not a soft failure. `makepkg -s` installs its dependencies from
# whatever database is present, and one 404 fails the WHOLE transaction, so
# every dependency goes unmet and the build ends at "Could not resolve all
# dependencies" -- naming qt6-base and five others that are all perfectly
# available. The line that says why is a `libwacom-2.19.1-1 ... 404` thirteen
# mirrors up, and it reads as a mirror problem rather than a stale index.
#
# -Syu and not -Sy: a refresh without the upgrade is the partial-upgrade state
# Arch refuses to support, and it produces the same 404 one library deeper.
# Failure is not fatal here -- an offline rebuild of packages that are all
# already in $OUT should still skip its way to a clean exit -- so the run that
# actually needs a package it cannot get fails at makepkg, with makepkg's
# reason, rather than here with a network one.
