# supports, and then hands it to a boot backend that turns it into something
# that device can boot (docs/devices.md D8). The artifact is a DIRECTORY and
# not an image file, and D10 says that is stated rather than papered over:
#
#   sargo      -> android-bootimg  boot.img + rootfs.simg + vbmeta.img + a
#                                  flash.sh, to fastboot onto a phone
#   willow     -> android-bootimg  the same without a vbmeta of its own
#
# One backend today. The indirection stays because it is the seam a second
# Qualcomm handset arrives through, and because it has been exercised by two
# (docs/devices.md D9).
#
# No loop devices: mkfs.ext4 -d and mcopy populate a filesystem image from a
# directory without mounting it. The chroot is what wants --privileged --
# configure.sh runs useradd, locale-gen and a package-database refresh inside

# --- provenance ------------------------------------------------------------
# What commit is this image? A published artifact that answers "none" cannot be
# rebuilt, bisected, or trusted to contain what its release notes claim.
#
# This is not hypothetical. An image built during a parallel session's edits
# picked up their uncommitted working tree, and one file in it matched neither
# HEAD nor the finished file -- it was copied mid-write. Nothing in the build
# noticed, and the only reason it was not published is that someone thought to
# compare hashes afterwards.
#
# So the commit goes in the image and beside it, and a dirty tree is refused
# unless the caller says otherwise.
#
# scripts/build-image.sh answers both questions on the HOST and passes them in,
# and that is not tidiness. /repo arrives as a read-only bind mount, which does
# not carry the inode and mtime metadata the host's .git/index recorded, so a
# stat-based `git diff-index --quiet HEAD` here calls all 159 tracked files
# modified with no content difference in any of them -- and the refresh that
# would settle it writes to .git/index, which this mount deliberately forbids.
#
# Only reached when this script is run directly. `git diff`, not `git
# diff-index`: it refreshes the index in memory before comparing, so it answers
# about content rather than about stat. Both directions were run against a
# read-only mount, clean and with one file edited.

# A base phone, then moarchy-meta, which pulls the entire phone UI through its

# is just running it in a chroot instead of on a device.
#
# The list below is the general phone: an init, a network stack, an audio
# stack, and the filesystem tools the rootfs needs. It names no hardware.
#
# pipewire-jack is named explicitly, and that is not cosmetic: pipewire-audio
# leaves the jack provider ambiguous, pacstrap prompts "1) jack2 2)
# pipewire-jack", and with no tty it takes the default -- so an unattended
# build silently shipped jack2 alongside pipewire. Naming it removes the
# prompt.
#
# The hardware is named ONCE, in moarchy-device-$DEVICE, and this line installs
# that package rather than its contents (docs/devices.md D2): the kernel, the
# firmware and the modem stack are all in its depends.
#
# moarchy-meta depends on the VIRTUAL name `moarchy-device` (D5), so naming the
# concrete package here is what decides which phone this image is for. It is
# also deliberately explicit: pacman could resolve the virtual name on its own
# while exactly one provider exists in the repo, and would silently start
