# Exercise the boot backends without building an image.
#
# Run: ./image/boot/test-backends.sh
#
# `bash -n` says a backend is fine when it is not. The bug this exists for:
# _set_dtb_name was renamed to _set_device_facts, backend_kernel's call was
# updated and backend_image's -- forty lines away -- was not. The file parsed
# perfectly, build.sh's "does it define all three hooks?" check passed, and the
# failure was `_set_dtb_name: command not found` at the very END of a
# forty-minute image build, after the pacstrap and the 6 GB filesystem.
#
# So this checks two things a parser cannot:
#
#   1. Every backend-private function that is CALLED is also DEFINED. That is
#      the rename bug, statically, in every hook including the ones that cannot
#      be run here.
#   2. The hooks that need no rootfs actually run: device facts resolve, fstab
#      is what the disk layout says, and an unknown DEVICE is refused rather
#      than silently producing an image for nothing.
#
# backend_kernel and backend_image are not run -- they need a populated rootfs
# and a container. Check (1) is what covers their bodies.
