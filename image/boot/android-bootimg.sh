# The Android boot backend: mkbootimg-style boot.img, AVB, fastboot.
#
# docs/devices.md D9, and D0's general case rather than the carve-out -- the
# Pixel 3a, the Fairphone 4 and 5 and every other Qualcomm handset with an
# unlockable bootloader are this shape: fastboot, an Android boot image, A/B
# slots, verified boot, non-removable storage. A second device on this backend
# should be a device package and a DTB name, not another file here.
#
# Sourced by image/build.sh, which calls the three hooks below. Produces a
# DIRECTORY rather than a single file, and D10 says that asymmetry with
# the difference is kept rather than papered over: there is no container both a `dd`
# workflow and a `fastboot flash` workflow could share that anything can read.
#
# Every offset, address and page size here was measured off a postmarketOS
# boot.img that demonstrably boots the target device (devices.md §8.1), and
# image/boot/test-android-image.py reproduces that image byte-for-byte from its
# own parts. None of it came from a wiki.

# The device-specific facts of the whole backend, which is the point -- a
# second Qualcomm phone adds a line here and changes nothing else.
#
#   DTB_NAME        the device tree appended to the kernel
#   ROOT_PARTLABEL  the GPT partition the rootfs is flashed to, and the name the
#                   kernel is given to find it again at boot (D24). A vendor
#                   fact: we do not choose it, we read it -- `blkid` on the
#                   handset reports PARTLABEL="userdata" for /dev/mmcblk0p72.
#
# Resolved in a function called BY THE HOOKS, not at source time. It was a bare
# `case` with a ${DTB_NAME:?} default, which meant sourcing this file with an
# unexpected DEVICE killed the shell before a single hook was defined -- so
# build.sh's "does this backend define all three hooks?" check reported a
# backend with no hooks at all, which is a far more alarming thing than the
# wrong device name. Sourcing a backend must never have side effects; it
# defines functions and does nothing else.

#
# `rw` here is load-bearing and not decoration. The kernel mounts root READ-ONLY
# (backend_image's cmdline says so, and the bootloader says so too) precisely so
# that systemd-fsck-root can run -- its ConditionPathIsReadWrite=!/ means a root
# already mounted rw is a root that is never checked. systemd-remount-fs then
# remounts / with the options on THIS line. If it said `ro`, the phone would

# last (devices.md D23, D25). What that means for every line below is that ABL
# has already set some of them, earlier, to values meant for Android -- and the
# kernel's __setup handlers keep the LAST occurrence, so these win.
#
#   root=PARTLABEL=  the GPT name, resolved by the kernel itself out of the
#                    partition table. Not LABEL=, which needs a udev that reads
#                    superblocks, which needs an initramfs (D24). ABL passes its
#                    own root=PARTUUID= for the Android system partition; this
#                    overrides it.
#   ro               so systemd-fsck-root can check the root before anything
#                    writes to it; /etc/fstab then remounts it rw. ABL sets ro
#                    too, but relying on that would be relying on a bootloader.
#   rootwait         eMMC is not necessarily probed by the time init runs.
#                    rootwait retries the WHOLE lookup, PARTLABEL included --
#                    devt_from_partlabel returns -ENODEV, not -EINVAL, so the
#                    wait is not disabled.
#   rootfstype=ext4  f2fs is built into this kernel too and registers first, so
#                    without this the kernel tries and fails f2fs before ext4.
#                    Harmless, and unreadable on a device with no console.
#   init=/sbin/init  THE one that is not optional. ABL appends init=/init, which
#                    is right for an Android ramdisk and wrong for every rootfs
#                    we will ever ship. An Arch root has no /init, and a failed
#                    init= is a kernel panic() with no fallback to /sbin/init --
#                    so the phone mounted root correctly and died one exec
#                    later, showing two penguins and nothing else, for a whole
#                    night. Do not remove this line.
#
# There is deliberately NO console= in sargo's, and adding one does nothing: ABL
# strips it and appends console=null. Verified from a shell on the device --
# `grep -o "console=[^ ]*" /proc/cmdline` returns console=null alone and
